The project requires Node and npm to run locally. After cloning the repo, run `npm install` in the project folder to install all dependencies.

A few scripts are available:

-   `npm run start` starts a local server on [127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
-   `npm run build` builds the project
-   `npm run deploy` deploys the project by building it and pushing to the `gh-pages` Git branch, where GitHub Pages is set up to run.
