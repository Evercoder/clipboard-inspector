# Clipboard Inspector

Working with the clipboard in web browsers is subject to many inconsistencies. This tool helps you explore the content of the clipboard when you paste something on a web page.

Run it online: [https://danburzo.github.io/clipboard-inspector/](https://danburzo.github.io/clipboard-inspector/)

## Reading from the clipboard

A `paste` event contains the `clipboardData` property, which has the following properties of interest:

* `types` is an array of MIME types available in the clipboard;
* `items` is a list of `DataTransferItem` objects (`DataTransferItemList`);
* `files` is a list of `File` objects available in the clipboard.

Additionally, `clipboardData` contains the `getData(type)` method to fetch a string representation of the data for a specific format.

In our context `DataTransferItem.getAsString()` seems to be useless, as textual data can be read synchronously through other methods.

## Browser support

## Running the project locally

The project requires Node and NPM/Yarn to run locally. It's built with React (piped through Babel / Webpack) — a bit more cumbersome to set up but makes it easy to prototype quickly.

After cloning the repo, run `yarn` (or `npm install`) in the project folder to install all dependencies. 

To start a local server:

`yarn start` (or `npm start`)

This will make the project available on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

To build the project:

`yarn build` (or `npm build`)

I use this to build the JS bundle in the `dist` folder so that you can access the tool online via Github Pages (the repo has Pages set up based on the `master` branch).
